This is my ouw repository of data structures in python 3.
Here are the basics Data Structures:

- Stack
- Deque
- Queue
- List  
    - UnorderedList
    - OrderedList

Stack
  A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at 
  the same end. This end is referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

  The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. 
  The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out. 
  It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.

Deque
  Deque (usually pronounced like "deck") is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that 
  can be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back).

Queue
  A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happends at one end, called the 'rear', and the removalo of existing items occurs
  at the other end, called the 'front'. As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when 
  it is the next element to be removed.
  
  And queue mantain a structure named FIFO, that is FIFO, first-in first-out.
  
List
  Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.
